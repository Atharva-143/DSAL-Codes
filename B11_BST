This project involves implementing a dictionary using a Binary Search Tree (BST), where users can add, delete, and update keyword entries with their corresponding meanings. The system will also provide functionality to display data in both ascending and descending order, and calculate the maximum number of comparisons needed to find any keyword. The goal is to enhance understanding of BST structures and apply them in dictionary operations.
